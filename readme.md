This is a minimal playable demo I did in order to learn gRPC. It involves a server with
a single entry RPC for calculating the Levenshtein distance between 2 words.

This demo includes a server and a client. The server is long-living (until stopped) and the
client runs several pre-defined RPC calls with different words.
